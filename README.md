Welcome to the FreeTakServer (FTS) git repository.

FTS  is a Python3 implementation of the TAK Server for devices like CivTAK , WinTAK and ITAK, it is cross-platform and is only dependent on python stdlib libraries. We use the Flask framework for web services. 
it's free and open source  (released under the Eclipse Public License).

## Use cases
FTS allows you to connect ATAK clients to share geo information, to chat with all the connected clients, exchange files and more.
It intends to support all the major use cases of the original TAK server.

## Community 
This code is currently in *ALPHA STAGE*
Check out our roadmap @ FreeTakServer#25 to see what is planned
If you have any issues don't hesitate to bring it up https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer/issues,  as TAKFreeServer is still in the early stages of development.

### Public instance
we support a public instance of FTS.
- download the configuration here

- use the Import manager in ATAK to import the configuration

## Architecture
TAKFreeServer uses a MVC pattern, the concept of a COT is described in a set of Domain classes, generated  from the UML model using a Model Driven Architecture approach.

The target architecture supports also the ability to implement "plugins", thanks to a listener, that is decouple from the main server

## Documentation
under docs, you can find various documents including an UMl model of the model classes involved in a COT event.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Installing and using FreeTakServer
### Prerequisites
- Install Python3

  `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 && sudo apt install pip3` (Ubuntu)
  
- install Flask


  `pip install flask`

- install git


  `pip install git`


- Clone TAKLib repository

  `git clone https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer.git`

### Linux

#### Run Server in console

```
cd TAKlib/TAKfreeServer/

python3 server.py
```

#### Run Server as Demon
see also https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer/tree/master/TAKfreeServer/TAKLinuxService
```
cd TAKlib/TAKfreeServer/TAKLinuxService

sudo python3 beginServerFromLinux.py
```

### Windows

#### DO NOT USE ----> Windows Service <--- CURRENTLY DEPRECATED

see also https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer/tree/master/TAKfreeServer/TAKWinService
To run this program you require admin priviliges

1. allow python.exe in firewall
2. open whichever port you will be using for connections in firewall
3. kill any program already running on whichever port you've decided to use
4. open CMD with admin
5. cd into whichever directory FreetakServer is located
```
Cd FreeTakServer/TakWinService
```
6. type the following
```
beginProgramAsService.py install
```
7. type
```
beginProgramAsService.py start
```

### side note
```
TAKFreeServer_running_as_service.py
```
can be run independently

### Troubleshooting
if you have this error Python windows service “Error starting service: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion”

attempt to add python to the system path
